# Fundamentals of Software Architecture

Software architecture is a crucial discipline that underpins the successful development, deployment, and maintenance of large and scalable software systems. It encompasses various specialties, each with a unique focus and role within the broader context of technology and business strategy.

## Types of Architecture

1. **Software:** Specialty that involves everything related to software development, including documentation, design, coding, testing, and deployment.
1. **Solution:** Specialty that focuses on the design of a system or application as whole. It is right between product and software.
1. **Technological:** Specialty in market-specific technologies such as Java, .NET, Elastic Stack, etc;
1. **Corporate:** Specialty in policies, procedures, and standards that strategically impact the organization as a whole.

## Why should you learn Software Architecture?

Learning software architecture is essential for developers, regardless of their aspirations to become software architects, as it allows for a broader and more detailed understanding of the functioning and evolution of systems. With knowledge in architecture, developers can make more informed decisions, evaluate different approaches, and choose the best solution for a given context. This understanding facilitates long-term maintenance, prevents excessive influence from new technologies, and allows for a more strategic view of the software's impact on the organization. Additionally, software architecture involves design patterns and best practices that contribute to efficiency and standardization in development. With this knowledge, developers gain confidence, make safer and more informed decisions, and better understand the value of their work, fostering a sense of belonging and motivation.

## Architecture vs Design

Learning software architecture and design are often viewed as the same, but they are actually distinct. **Architecture:** refers to the global scope of software, considering high-level aspects like componentization, communication methods, and abstractions. It ensures that quality attributes, high-level constraints, and business objectives are met. On the other hand, **Design** focuses on a more local scope, like reducing a class's responsibilities and implementing patterns to facilitate strategies. While all architectural activities involve design, not all design activities are architectural. For instance, high-level decisions like using Open Telemetry for logging are architectural, but the specific code implementation is a design decision. Architectural decisions impact the broader system, whereas design decisions may be more localized and not visible outside their component. This distinction is important, though not universally accepted.

## Pillars of Software Architecture

The pillars of software architecture are the fundamental concepts that guide the design and implementation of software systems. They include:

1. **Structure:** Refers to the organization of components and their relationships. It needs to be flexible, scalable, and maintainable, while attending the business requirements.
1. **Components:** Are the building blocks of the system. They should be cohesive, loosely coupled, and reusable.
1. **Relationship between systems:** Refers to how systems interact with each other. It should be clear, efficient, and secure.
1. **Governance:** Refers to the rules and policies that guide the architecture. It should ensure that the architecture is properly documented, implemented, and maintained.

## Architectural Requirements

Architectural requirements are the constraints and quality attributes that guide the design and implementation of a system. They include all the areas of the company that the system will touch. Some examples are:

1. **Performance:** Respond to user requests within a specific time frame.
1. **Data Storage:** Store and retrieve data efficiently, according to the business requirements. A given system could be enforced by law to store their data on a specific location, for example.
1. **Scalability:** Grow and handle increased demand.
1. **Security:** Protect data and resources from unauthorized access and have required security certifications.
1. **Legal and Compliance:** Comply with laws and regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
1. **Audit:** Track and log events for auditing purposes.
1. **Marketing:** Track and analyze user behavior, providing insights for marketing strategies.
